# Cinema

 This repository contains a cinema website I made for a school project called JereMovies, the name is a combination of my name (Jeremy) and the word Movies.
 The project consists of a website and a database. On the website you can view information about the "cinema" and the movies.
 Whenever you're logged in with an account that has admin rights you can also make use of the CRUD functionality of the movies.
